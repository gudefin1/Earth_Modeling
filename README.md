# Earth_Modeling

Project Description 🌍✨

This project involves creating a 3D simulation of Earth 🌎 and exporting it as a .obj file 🗂️ using pure Python 🐍. The goal is to apply programming and geometric modeling concepts 📐 to generate a textured sphere 🌐 that represents the planet, including continents, oceans, and optionally atmospheric features ☁️.

The output file will be ready for use in 3D visualization tools like Blender 🖌️ and MeshLab 🔍.

Key Features 🌟
🌍 Realistic 3D Earth Simulation
🗂️ Export to .obj format
✨ Compatible with popular 3D tools like Blender and MeshLab
Tech Stack ⚙️
🐍 Pure Python (no external libraries!)
🎯 Goal: To demonstrate the power of Python by creating a detailed 3D representation of Earth from scratch! 🚀
